How to play
The game follows the rules of classic Tetris. The goal of the game is to stack falling blocks (called Tetriminos) 
in a way that creates complete rows. The completed rows will then disappear, and the player earns points.
 The game ends when the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of the screen.

The player can move the Tetriminos left and right using the arrow keys.
 They can rotate the Tetriminos using the up arrow key. The down arrow key
  will make the Tetriminos fall faster.
